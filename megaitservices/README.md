It is a internship assignment
Creating a fully functional e-commerce website with the necessary features as outlined in the provided references is a comprehensive task. Below is a high-level plan for rebuilding the e-commerce website with must-have features, along with example code snippets to get you started. The full implementation would require significant effort and time, so I'll provide guidance on the critical components and initial setup.
