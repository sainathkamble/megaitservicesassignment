It is a internship assignment
Creating a fully functional e-commerce website with the necessary features as outlined in the provided references is a comprehensive task. Below is a high-level plan for rebuilding the e-commerce website with must-have features, along with example code snippets to get you started. The full implementation would require significant effort and time, so I'll provide guidance on the critical components and initial setup.

Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Payment Gateway: Stripe
Deployment
To deploy the application:

Backend: Deploy on a service like Heroku.
Frontend: Deploy on a service like Netlify or Vercel.
Access and Testing
Provide the deployment links for both frontend and backend. Create test user accounts and share the credentials for backend verification.

This guide provides a starting point. Developing a complete e-commerce site with all essential features will require further steps, including setting up product models, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and integrating payment gateways.
